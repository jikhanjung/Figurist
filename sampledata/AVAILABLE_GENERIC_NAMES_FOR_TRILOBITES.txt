P.A. JELL AND J.M. ADRAIN 
Jell, P.A. & Adrain, J.M. 30 8 2002: Available generic names for trilobites. Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 48(2): 331-553. Brisbane. ISSN0079-8835. 
Aconsolidated list of available generic names introduced since the beginning of the binomial nomenclature system for trilobites is presented for the first time. Each entry is accompanied by the author and date of availability, by the name of the type species, by a lithostratigraphic or biostratigraphic and geographic reference for the type species, by a family assignment and by an age indication of the type species at the Period level (e.g. MCAM, LDEV). A second listing of these names is taxonomically arranged in families with the families listed alphabetically, higher level classification being outside the scope of this work. We also provide a list of names that have apparently been applied to trilobites but which remain nomina nuda within the ICZN definition.

Trilobite fossils attracted the attention of could find. This list was copied on an early spirit humans in different parts of the world from the stencil machine to some 20 or more trilobite very beginning, probably even prehistoric times. workers around the world, principally those who In the 1700s various European natural historians would author the 1959 Treatise edition. Weller began systematic study of living and fossil also drew on this compilation for his Presidential organisms including trilobites. The name address to the Paleontological Society in 1951 Trilobita was introduced by Walch in 1771, at (Weller, 1952). However, his list was never about the same time that Carl Linnaeus was dev-published and to our knowledge no accompany-eloping his system of binomial nomenclature. ing bibliography was ever compiled. In the 1959 The early 1800s witnessed a number of mono-Treatise the bibliography is very select and large graphic works on Palaeozoic fossils including numbers of the author citations of generic names numerous trilobites. Major works of Dalman are not included. (1827), Brongniart (1822), Wahlenberg (1821), 
By the 1980s, when early preparations were Hawle & Corda (1847), Angelin (1851, 1854) underway for a revision of the trilobite volume of and Barrande (1846-1872) accelerated the syst-the Treatise a large increase in the number of ematic study of trilobites so that by 1893 when generic names to be dealt with had occurred. To Vogdes produced the first annotated bibliography assess the extent of the increase Harry Whit-it was printed on over 400 pages. With sub-tington and Simon Kelly compiled a list of genera sequent additions (Vogdes, 1917, 1925) his work erected after publication of the first Treatise provides the most comprehensive, if not always edition up to 1983. This list contained about 2500 the most accurate, reference work for entrance to names having been compiled from the Zoological trilobite studies of the 19th century. 
Record and from lists provided by various individuals. This list was distributed to prospect-In the 20th century the volume of public-ive authors of the revised trilobite volume of the ations was such that the only comprehensive Treatise but not otherwise published. 
survey of trilobites was at the generic level, in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (Moore, The 1959 Treatise dealt with approximately 1959; Kaesler, 1997). Early in the preparation of 1200 trilobite generic names and the first revised the first edition of the trilobite volume of the volume of the trilobite (Part O) Treatise (1997) Treatise J. Marvin Weller of the University of dealt with about 500 generic names although Chicago compiled a list of trilobite generic Weller (1952) had indicated 1436 were known in names that would need to be dealt with in the 1950. Thus the list presented below, with more Treatise. Weller¡¯s checklist included all names than 5000 generic names, represents a 430% and variations including mispellings that he increase in available generic names in the last 50 years. Weller¡¯s (1952, fig. 11) projection of the rate of trilobite generic increase has not been realised; he correctly foresaw that it would not be possible. However, the aggregate number of 5000+ far excedes his calculated maximum curve which had a projection of fewer than 3000 in the year 2000. Given Weller¡¯s experience we are not so bold as to anticipate the future. However, the 1990s saw a marked reduction in the number of new names introduced probably due to the diminishing number of active taxonomists in the field and possibly due also to decreasing areas of Palaeozoic outcrop remaining to be investigated. 
The current paper arose from independent ef¡©forts by each of us. JMA had compiled Ord¡©ovician and Silurian genera in support of studies by Adrain et al. (1988) and Adrain & Westrop (2000) and this list had been freely available since 1998. PAJ assembled Cambrian generic names to define the extent of the Ptychopar¡©ioidea and extended this to present a paper on the rate of appearance of generic names. That paper was delivered at the Third International Confer¡©ence on trilobites and their relatives in Oxford, April, 2001,where we agreed to join forces to produce a comprehensive list. Broadly speaking PAJ is responsible for the Cambrian compilation, JMA for the Ordovician and Silurian and JMA and PAJ for the Devonian to Permian. 
We hope that our effort herein will be a significant aid to all students of trilobites in their considerations of whether or not to erect new generic names. All too frequently we see names passing to synonymy because the full literature search had not been undertaken or because the full extent of the family concerned had not been scanned. We hope this publication will be an invitation to be more comprehensive in consider¡©ation of generic assignments and in discussions of affinities. Moreover, we anticipate its use in other ways not the least of which may be quantitative biodiversity studies. 
METHOD OF ASSEMBLY 
We present both objective and subjective data. The bibliography is objective whereas the syst¡©ematic arrangement is almost entirely subjective. In the alphabetical listing data are objective ex¡©cept for family assignment and age. We have tried. as far as possible, to consult the original literature when compiling objective data. We have listed available names associated with trilobites, i.e. those names that entered the literature meeting the necessary criteria of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. 
Most of these remain valid names for trilobite genera but many have become invalid as junior synonyms, junior homonyms, unjustified emendations, unnecessary substitute names or suppressed names but they all remain available irrespective of any such subsequent history. 
Alphabetical listing. 
Each available generic name is followed by the author (all upper case) and year of publ¡©ication. The type species (as originally cited) follows in square brackets. Next are data on the type locality of the type species. Where possible the rock formation containing the type locality is quoted with the State or Province and/or country. If the formation is not known we try to provide the biozone of the type horizon or failing that the best geographic data available. In dealing with larger countries we quote the state or province but in many cases only the country is quoted. This is followed, after a semicolon, by the family assignment (all in upper case) which cross refers to the later systematic listing. Following the last semicolon is an indication of the age of the type horizon of the type species. This is in the form of abbreviations of the Palaeozoic periods namely Cambrian (CAM), Ordovician (ORD), Silurian (SIL), Devonian (DEV) and Permian (PERM) or subperiods of the Carboniferous i.e. the Mississ¡©ippian (MISS) or Pennsylvanian (PENN) prefixed by L (lower), M (middle) or U (upper) or combinations of these where appropriate. 
At the end of many entries is an anotation in square brackets indicating known synonymies. The first three letters are an abbreviation of junior (j.) or senior (s.); objective (o.) or subjective (s.); synonyms (s.) followed by the relative generic name and then the authority we rely on for these relationships. Although we have attempted to quote the earliest author to recognise synonymies it is possible that we may in some cases unknow¡©ingly be quoting a secondary source. Some synonymies proposed in the literature are not quoted herein because we do not accept them. In other cases, where synonymies have been proposed and subsequently denied or altered we have attempted to present our view of the most probable current situation. 
In the case of names that are junior objective synonyms (j.o.s.) or were preoccupied and have been replaced this is indicated in square brackets at that name with relevant data supplied at the senior objective or replacement name. While there are very many examples of misspellings of generic names throughout the history of trilobite publications most of these are obvious typo¡©graphical errors and those variant spellings are not included in our lists. However, in some cases we have identified that these errors have caused confusion or are simply not obvious in their meaning so we have included these examples in the list indicating the error in square brackets. 
Bibliography 
This list contains all references cited in the alphabetical list so that it includes papers in which new generic names were erected, in which species were erected that were subsequently des¡©ignated as generic types and in which accepted synonymies were proposed. Please note this does not constitute a complete list of papers on the taxonomy of trilobites although it contains a very high percentage of such papers. Whereas common bibliographic practice is to provide a transliteration and a translation of titles of papers in the Russian language we have provided only the translation in the interests of economy of space. 
We have indicated papers published in languages using other than the arabic characters by enclosing their titles in square brackets. While transliteration of the names of Russian and Chinese authors into English has varied with the different translation standards employed we have endeavoured to maintain spellings that are recognisable and consistent thus giving the best chance of recognition over time. For example we quote CHERNYSHEVA not TCHERNY¡©SHEVA, EGOROVA not YEGOROVA, XIANG not HSIANG, ZHANG not CHANG, ZHU not CHU etc. We have indicated most of these var¡©iants by a cross reference in the list of literature. 
Although there are a number of instances where authors with the same family name appear in the bibliography (e.g. ALBERTI, HAHN, RICHTER, YUAN and ZHOU) their association with the year of publication removes any confusion. However, in the case of the family name ZHANG confusion is possible between six separate authors and it is with this name alone that an initial is included throughout the alphabetical list. 
Papers with more that 2authors are referred to in the alphabetical list by the first author and others (e.g. GORYANSKY et al., 1964). 
Systematic listing 
This list reflects our own findings in many areas along with our assessments of other workers opinions in groups with which we may not have direct experience ourselves. We acknowledge that disagreements remain among trilobite workers in some groups and that our arrangement may not be universally accepted. However, by including all generic names we hope that future classifications will seek to deal more comprehensively with related genera. 
We group the genera into families and although we recognise the considerable effort some workers have put into defining sub-and superfamilies (particularly e.g. in the Proetidae, Redlichiidae, Ellipsocephalidae, or Asaphidae) we observe that general agreement has not been reached and in most cases such classifications have not been comprehensive in placing all relevant genera. We therefore, prefer to suggest broader groupings that can be assessed for intrafamilial classifications by more detailed investigations. 
Nomina nuda 
We provide a list of generic names, apparently referring to trilobites, that remain, as far as we are aware, nomina nuda as defined in the International Code of Zoological Nomen¡©clature. The list is provided as a reference should these names appear in any future literature by way of validation or further use as nomina nuda. This list is not as exhaustive as the list of available names and we have not attempted to include all literature relevant to these nomina nuda. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
PAJ is grateful to J. Marvin Weller, Harry Whit-tington and Simon Kelly for the unpublished lists, mentioned above, which, along with the 1959 Treatise and the Zoological Record, were the initial basis for the Cambrian compilation. PAJ thanks Pete Palmer who engaged in an extensive mutually beneficial crosscheck of the Cambrian listing against his database (SYNPL¡©US). We are grateful to Zhang Wentang, Tatyana Pegel, Carsten Brauckmann, Greg Edgecombe, Peng Shanchi, Zhou Zhiyi, David Holloway, Gerd Geyer, Richard Fortey and others who were ever ready to answer our questions about partic¡©ular problems and in many cases provided unsol¡©icited improvements to our compilation. PAJ is thankful to Kathy Buckley, Meg Lloyd and Victoria Harrison of the Queensland Museum and JMAis thankful to Tom Hegna, University of Iowa, all of whom ably sought out difficult-to-obtain materials for us. 
NOTES 
1. 
A number of homonyms are identified in the compilation of this list and replacement names are introduced where necessary. Generic names introduced are:-Eoasaphiscellus, Paracaly¡©menemene, Paralorenzangella, Pterocephal¡©opsinus and Trigonyangaspis. 

2. 
According to Vogdes (1893) Rafinesque 1832introduced Telesiops and Promenites and indicated that in 1817 he had introduced Glomerites and that in 1821 he had introduced Alloctops, Diplopsites, Tomoligus, Isoctomesa and Retusites. To our knowledge these names have not been subsequently used and certainly not in any modern sense. We are unable to identify any specimens that can be attached to these names much less any identifiable type specimens. While these apparently remain available names we have not been able to provide any of the serialised data we are attaching to other names in the list. 

3. 
Members of the Nektaspida have generally been regarded as trilobites or closely related to trilobites and on that basis are included in this listing. However, classification within the group remains highly contentious so we do not attempt any family classification at this stage even though one could confidently say that Naraoia belongs to the Naraoiidae. We exclude Maritimella and Orientella of Repina & Okuneva (1969) accepting the observation of Robison (1984) that these are pseudofossils. 

4. 
Clarkson & Howells (1981) and Howells (1982) considered several names proposed by Lamont (1978), including the encrinurid genus-group names Aristobeggia, Calgachia, Leitchia, Macguiganella, Paracalgachia, and Trippia,as invalid. Clarkson & Howells (1981) argued on the basis of type material, citing Article 13A of the then-current edition of the ICZN. Howells (1982) argued that the names were not supported with adequate diagnoses. In the former case, problems with subsequent identification of type specimens, and the fact that the designated type specimens may not be well enough preserved to permit recognition of the taxa, do not appear to have bearing on the availability of the names, but rather indicate that they should be regarded as nomina dubia. For Howells¡¯s (1982) arguments about diagnoses, Aristobeggia, Leitchia, Para-calgachia, and Trippia are each accompanied by an explicit diagnosis in Lamont (1978) and hence satisfy Article 13 of the ICZN. Calgachia and Macguiginella, however, lack a diagnosis or any 


comparative statements. They fail to satisfy Article 13.1.1, and should be regarded as nomina nuda. 
5. 
In accordance wth Article 23.9 of the ICZN, Goniopleura is designated a nomen oblitum and suppressed, and Maurotarion is considered a nomen protectum, and a valid name. As far as we are aware, Goniopleura has never been used as a valid name subsequent to its original publication. Maurotarion is in widespread use as a presumed valid name for the group (e.g., Adrain & Chatter¡©ton, 1995; Adrain & Edgecombe, 1996; Alberti, 1969; Curtis & Lane, 1997; Edgecombe & Fortey, 2000; Holloway, 1994; Sandford, 2000). 

6. 
The synonymy of Hsuaspis and Estaingia (Jell in Bengtson et al., 1990) has been accepted by a number of subsequent authors to whom PAJ apologises for identifying the senior synonym without referring to the original publication. PAJ recently obtained a copy of the Science Journal, Academia Sinica volume 5 (W. Zhang in W. Zhang et al., 1957) in which Hsuaspis was first mentioned. That publication contains a line drawing labelled Hsuaspis sinensis and the name is mentioned in a faunal list for an horizon in the section being described. In a second publication in the same year (W. Zhang, 1957) the new name is mentioned on the correlation chart with a footnote indicating its type species. Neither of these 1957 mentions of the name satisfies the ICZN criteria for availability. The name must be considered a nomen nudum in each of these publications. Thus Hsuaspis became available in Lu et al. (1965), a year after Pocock had erected its synonym Estaingia, which must be con¡©sidered the senior name. Availability of Ichangia similarly dates from Lu et al. (1965) and not from 


W. Zhang in W. Zhang et al., 1957), as commonly quoted. 
A second apology from PAJ is for having mis¡©sed the introduction of the family-group name Estaingiinae by pik (1975a) and inadvertantly using the junior synonym Ichangiidae for this group of trilobites. Estangiinae is the senior family-group name and is elevated to Estaing¡©iidae herein to replace Ichangiidae. 
7. Anchiopella was introduced by Reed (1907b) for a subgroup of D. anchiops that he referred to as the cristagalli subgroup. He confirmed this as his type species designation in a later paper. Lesperance & Bourque (1971) out¡©lined in detail the difficult history of Anchiopella and Anchiopsis and concluded that both are avail¡©able names. We agree with their conclusions. 
Thus, in the absence of good reason to suppress Anchiopella, Cooper¡¯s (1982) action of assigning cristagalli to Bainella means that Bainella be¡©comes a junior subjective synonym of Anch¡©iopella. 
8. Shergold et al. (1988) detailed the nomen¡©clatural history of Szechuanella. It was intro¡©duced, with type species szechuanensis,asano-men nudum by Lu (1959). Zhang & Fan (1960) described a new species, rectangula, and as¡©signed it to Szechuanella while quoting Lu¡¯s szechuanensis as the type species even though it remained a nomen nudum until made available by Lu in 1962. Shergold et al. (1988) considered that the act of Zhang & Fan using Szechuanella in association with an available species group name made rectangula the type species by monotypy. This was accepted by Peng (1990) who cons¡©idered S. szechuanensis Lu, 1962to belong to Paraszechuanella LIU, 1977. Thus we agree that Szechuanella became available through Zhang & Fan (1960) with its type species rectangula by monotypy. Paraszechuanella LIU, in ZHOU et al., 1977 has P. latilimbata as type species and contains szechuanensis Lu, 1962. 
The history of Paraacidaspis, detailed by Shergold et al. (2000), has the name introduced as a nomen nudum in 1957and considered a nomen nudum again in Poletaeva¡¯s 1960 paper (Bruton, 1987). However, Poletaeva made available P. sibirica in 1960 and thus created a direct analogy with Szechuanella wherein Paraacidaspis was used in association with an available species name even though the quoted type species, hunanica, remained a nomen nudum until Poletaeva made it available in 1963. Thus when Shergold et al. (2000) attributed Paraacidaspis to Poletaeva, 1963 with the type species hunanica also dating from Poletaeva, 1963 they employed a different logic to that which had been applied to Szechuanella. These are exactly analogous cases and Paraacidaspis must be considered to date from Poletaeva, 1960 with P. sibirica the type species by monotypy. If anything Paraacidaspis has a better claim to availability in Poletaeva (1960) than does Szechuanella in Zhang & Fan (1960) because Poletaeva expressly diagnosed the genus whereas Zhang & Fan diagnosed the species. However, the latter can be taken to be a generic diagnosis because it applies to the only available species-group taxon contained therein. 
9. In accordance with Article 23.9 of the ICZN, Dicranactis is designated a nomen oblitum (and suppressed) and Scabriscutellum is considered a nomen protectum(and valid). Dicranactis has not been used in the modern literature (Snajdr, 1984) and Scabriscutellum is in widespread use as a presumed valid name for the group (Alberti, 1971, 1981b, 1983; Archinal, 1994; Basse, 1996; Feist, 1974; Lutke, 1965; Maksimova, 1960, 1979).
